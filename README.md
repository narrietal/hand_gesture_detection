# Live Hand Tracking and Gesture Detection
Project developed for a Computer Vision course at Polytech Nice Sophia University. It involved the detection and tracking of the hand and the classification of hand gestures. 

The project is divided in nine deliveries which are fully documented in notebooks. In short, during the project I used CamShift to detect in real time a face through a web cam. Then I erased the face detection in order to detect a hand in the webcam. Once done, I created my own dataset of hand gestures to train a simple NN and test the resulting model in real time. Finally, I used transfer learning to use a pre-trained VGG model and I did a comparison of performance with the previous simple NN model.
